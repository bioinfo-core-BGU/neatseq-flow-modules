Generic Modules
========================================

The generic modules, called ``Generic`` and ``Fillout_Generic``, do not contain a definition of input and output file types, therefore the user has to specify the input and output file types in the parameter file.

* ``Generic`` is simpler to use for defining most Linux programs, and has extra file type management capacities.
* ``Fillout_Generic`` can incorporate more than one command per step, as well as cater to irregular program calls, such as calls including complex pipes; however, using it is slightly more complicated.
